# Meal plan web application

### 1. Executive Summary

The Personalized Food Ingredient Sales Platform focuses on delivering fresh ingredients alongside customized recipes to support health and fitness goals. Users register accounts to access a diverse recipe database, receive AI-driven meal suggestions based on nutritional needs (weight loss, muscle gain, or balanced health) and purchase history. The system enables portion customization, precise calorie/macro calculations, and direct ingredient ordering with doorstep delivery, ensuring convenience and quality. Leveraging AWS Serverless, the platform ensures flexible scalability, high performance, and secure management.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

### What’s the Problem?

Users often struggle with planning healthy meals, calculating calories and macros, and sourcing ingredients tailored to fitness goals like weight loss or muscle gain. Existing platforms provide recipe and menu suggestions but lack direct ingredient sales, requiring users to independently source supplies, which is time-consuming and prone to errors in portioning.

### The Solution

The platform employs Spring Boot for a robust REST API backend handling user registration, recipe management, shopping cart, and order processing, with React delivering a user-friendly frontend featuring AI-driven meal recommendations. Data is stored in AWS RDS (PostgreSQL), images and static assets in Amazon S3, with the backend deployed on Amazon EC2 within a secure VPC, and Route 53 managing the domain. Users can customize portions, receive personalized recipe suggestions, and order ingredients for delivery. Key features include a diverse recipe library, accurate calorie calculations, CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline, and low operational costs.

### Benefits and Return on Investment

The solution establishes a comprehensive platform for the nutrition startup to expand services while collecting user data for enhanced recommendation systems. It eliminates manual calorie calculations and fragmented shopping through an integrated system, simplifying nutrition planning and driving revenue from ingredient sales. Estimated monthly costs are $17.43 (per AWS Pricing Calculator), totaling approximately $209 for 12 months. Development leverages open-source frameworks, incurring no additional hardware costs. ROI is expected within 6–12 months through user time savings and consistent order revenue.

### 3. Solution Architecture

The platform leverages a secure, scalable, and automated **AWS architecture** to host and deploy web applications following **CI/CD** best practices. It integrates infrastructure automation, high availability, and global content delivery using AWS services. Source code is managed in **GitLab** and automatically deployed to private **EC2** instances via **CodePipeline** and **CodeDeploy**. Security is enforced at multiple layers through **IAM**, **WAF**, and **Secrets Manager**, while **CloudFront**, **ALB**, and **Auto Scaling** ensure performance and resilience. Monitoring and logging are managed through **CloudWatch** and **CloudTrail**. The architecture is detailed below:

![Architecture Diagram](/images/AWS_Architecture.drawio_6.png)

## AWS Services Used

- **Amazon Route 53:** Manages DNS and routes user traffic to CloudFront.
- **AWS WAF:** Protects the application from DDoS and common web vulnerabilities.
- **Amazon CloudFront:** Globally caches and delivers content to minimize latency.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Distributes incoming requests across EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones.
- **Amazon EC2 (Auto Scaling Group):** Runs the application workload with dynamic scaling for high performance and cost efficiency.
- **Amazon S3 (Media Storage):** Stores static content, images, videos, and other media assets.
- **Amazon S3 (Code Storage):** Stores build artifacts and deployment packages generated by the CI/CD process.
- **AWS CodePipeline:** Automates the continuous integration and deployment workflow.
- **AWS CodeBuild:** Builds and tests source code before deployment.
- **AWS CodeDeploy:** Automates application deployments to EC2 instances.
- **AWS IAM:** Manages access control and permissions securely across AWS services.
- **AWS Secrets Manager:** Stores and protects sensitive credentials such as passwords and API keys.
- **Amazon Cognito:** Provides user authentication and authorization management.
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitors system and application metrics, triggers alerts, and collects logs.
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Records all API activity for auditing and compliance purposes.
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Provides an isolated network environment for secure application deployment.
- **NAT Gateway:** Enables outbound Internet access from private subnets in a controlled and secure manner.
- **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Connects the VPC to the public Internet for routing and service access.
- **VPC Endpoints:** Allow private connectivity between VPC resources and AWS services (such as S3 and CloudWatch) without traversing the Internet.

## Component Design

### Networking

The infrastructure is deployed within a **VPC** that spans multiple **Availability Zones** for high availability.  
Each AZ contains:

- A **Public Subnet** hosting a **NAT Gateway** and **Internet Gateway (IGW)** for outbound Internet access.
- A **Private Subnet** running the **Application Tier** and **Data Tier**, isolated from public traffic.

Private subnets communicate securely with AWS services (such as S3) through **VPC Endpoints**, ensuring that no traffic leaves the AWS network.

### Traffic Management

Users access the application via **Route 53**, which routes DNS requests to **CloudFront** for global content caching and delivery.  
**AWS WAF** provides web protection and filters malicious requests before traffic reaches the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.  
The **ALB** distributes requests to EC2 instances managed in an **Auto Scaling Group** across multiple Availability Zones.

### Application Layer

The **Auto Scaling Group** in private subnets hosts application instances, managed automatically based on demand.  
Applications can securely reach external resources via **NAT Gateways** for updates or API calls.

### Data Tier

The data tier resides in private subnets for maximum security, communicating internally with the application tier and AWS storage via **VPC Endpoints**.

### Storage

Two types of storage are used:

- **Media Storage (Amazon S3):** Stores static assets and media files accessible via the VPC Endpoint.
- **Code Storage (Amazon S3):** Stores build artifacts and deployment packages generated by the CI/CD pipeline.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Developers commit source code to **GitLab**, which triggers **AWS CodePipeline**.  
The pipeline automates:

1. **CodeBuild:** Builds and tests the source code.
2. **CodeStorage (S3):** Saves build artifacts.
3. **CodeDeploy:** Deploys application packages to EC2 instances in the private subnet.

This setup ensures continuous integration and delivery within a secure and automated AWS environment.

### Security

Security is enforced at multiple layers:

- **IAM** for access control and permissions.
- **Cognito** for user authentication and authorization.
- **WAF** for web application protection.
- **Secrets Manager** for storing API keys and credentials securely.  
  Traffic between components is restricted using private networking, NAT Gateways, and VPC Endpoints.

### Monitoring & Logging

**CloudWatch** tracks performance metrics and provides real-time alerts.  
**CloudTrail** logs all API calls for auditing and compliance purposes.

### Architecture Benefits

- **High Availability:** Multi-AZ deployment with ALB and Auto Scaling.
- **Enhanced Security:** Multi-layer protection via WAF, IAM, and Secrets Manager.
- **Full Automation:** GitLab-triggered CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.
- **Private Networking:** Secure internal communication via VPC Endpoints and private subnets.
- **Optimized Performance:** CloudFront content caching and distributed routing through Route53.

### 4. Technical Implementation

**Implementation Phases**  
This project has two parts—developing Spring Boot back-end and React frontend and deploy the website to AWS using AWS services each following 4 phases

- **Build Theory and Draw Architecture:** Gather requirements for the meal plan website, design system architecture (Spring Boot REST API + React frontend), and define the database schema (Month 1).
- **Develop, Test:** Implement the Spring Boot backend with REST APIs (authentication, user management, meal/recipe CRUD, shopping cart, etc.), and build the React frontend (UI/UX, routing, forms, state management). Conduct unit tests for backend services, integration tests for API endpoints, and frontend tests (Jest/React Testing Library). (Month 1–2)
- **Calculate Price and Check Practicality:** Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs for EC2 (backend hosting), RDS (database), S3 (static files and images), VPC (network), Route53 (domain) then adjust if needed (Month 2).
- **AWS Integration:** Integrate AWS services into the application. Deploy the website on **EC2**, store pictures on **S3**, configure **Database on EC2**, using **VPC** for managing network, **Route53** for domain, and set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline). Perform staging tests before final production release. (Month 3)
