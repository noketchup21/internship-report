## Accelerate Marketing Campaign Planning by 3x with Treasure Data AI Agents Powered by Amazon Bedrock


Marketing teams face significant challenges when planning and executing campaigns across multiple channels. Traditional campaign development requires months of coordination between systems and teams for hypothesis creation, audience analysis, journey mapping, content development, activation, and measurement. This lengthy process causes brands to miss critical moments when customers are ready to engage.

[Treasure Data’s customer data platform (CDP)](https://www.treasuredata.com/product/intelligent-cdp/) serves major brands globally, managing customer profiles that represent a significant portion of the internet-connected population. Working with Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), the company leveraged [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to create AI-powered solutions for marketing teams. Amazon Bedrock provides fully managed access to high-performing [foundation models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html) for building generative AI applications, allowing organizations to deploy AI agents that understand natural language instructions and interact with various systems autonomously.

This blog explores how Treasure Data’s AI-powered offerings, built on Amazon Bedrock, transform campaign creation from a months-long process into hours or days. These solutions enable marketing and CX teams to respond quickly to market opportunities and deliver personalized experiences at scale while maintaining the security and governance standards required by enterprise customers.

### Building AI Agents on a Foundation of Trusted Data

The true power of AI lies in combining advanced foundation models with high-quality customer data. The integration between Treasure Data’s platform and Amazon Bedrock enables marketers to analyze customer data quickly, generate targeted audience segments, create detailed personas, and make data-driven decisions without requiring technical expertise. This combination reduces campaign creation time dramatically while improving targeting accuracy and campaign performance.

### Collaborative Development with AWS

Treasure Data worked closely with AWS to identify key bottlenecks in traditional campaign planning and execution processes. Rather than simply adding a chat interface to existing tools, the collaboration focused on redesigning fundamental workflows to maximize AI effectiveness.

The partnership emphasized finding the right balance between human expertise and AI capabilities. Marketing professionals retain strategic oversight while AI agents handle time-intensive analytical tasks. This approach required building agents that could process complex data relationships and provide actionable insights grounded in actual customer behavior.

The collaboration resulted in a multi-agent framework built on Amazon Bedrock that addresses specific marketing challenges while maintaining the security and compliance standards required by enterprise customers.

### How Amazon Bedrock Powers This Innovation

Treasure Data selected Amazon Bedrock as the foundation for its AI agents because it enables rapid deployment without sacrificing control or security. Amazon Bedrock simplifies model selection, allowing teams to access advanced foundation models without requiring specialized data science expertise.

The fully managed platform enables quick deployment to production environments without building custom infrastructure from scratch. Customer data remains private and secure within the shared responsibility model between AWS and customers. AWS secures the underlying infrastructure while customers maintain control over their content and access controls.

The combination of Treasure Data’s customer data expertise and AI foundation models, provided by Amazon Bedrock, enables organizations to scale AI initiatives while maintaining security and governance standards.

### Meet Treasure Data’s Specialized AI Agents

Treasure Data has developed several purpose-built AI agents, powered by Amazon Bedrock, to address specific marketing challenges. Each agent targets critical pain points in the campaign planning and execution process.

The [Audience Agent](https://www.treasuredata.com/product/ai-agents/) enables marketers to discover and create high-value audience segments from behavioral signals quickly without needing SQL or advanced data skills. Data analysis and audience segmentation become faster and more accurate as the agent identifies patterns in customer behavior automatically. Figure 1 shows Audience Agent, which retrieves customer data based on queries. For example, when asked ‘I’d like to understand my most loyal customers,’ it identifies relevant attributes and presents the results.

The [Deep Research & Analysis Agent](https://www.treasuredata.com/blog/deep-research-analysis-agent/) compresses hypothesis-building processes from months to less than a week. Instead of spending extensive time on manual analysis and marketing, customer teams can generate high-quality hypotheses grounded in behavioral signals that inform strategy, testing, and execution decisions. Treasure Data’s Deep Insight Platform provides “Question Management” capability, which lets users pose questions for multiple analyses such as Churn Rate Trend and Email Performance Analysis as shown in Figure 2.

Available as part of Treasure Data’s [CDP Trade-Up](https://www.treasuredata.com/cdp-trade-up/) program, the [Migration Agent](https://www.treasuredata.com/cdp-trade-up/) accelerates transitions from existing customer data platforms by up to 60%. It extracts queries, segments, and transformation logic from current systems and automatically generates SQL, pipelines, and orchestration workflows. This agent helps organizations preserve their segments, workflows, and business logic when moving data, avoiding the need to start from scratch.

These agents use retrieval augmented generation (RAG), combining data processing capabilities, with the power of Amazon Bedrock inference, to provide accurate and data-grounded responses. This ensures AI suggestions reflect actual customer behavior rather than generic recommendations.

### Introducing Treasure Data’s AI Agent Foundry

While the pre-built agents address common marketing challenges, Treasure Data customers expressed the need to create customized agents tailored to their unique business requirements and industry-specific use cases. [The AI Agent Foundry](https://www.treasuredata.com/product/ai-agent-foundry/) emerged as the solution to this demand.

The AI Agent Foundry serves as the foundation for building custom AI agents tailored to specific business needs. Marketing, customer experience, and data teams can create, refine, and deploy agents without deep technical knowledge. High-impact use cases could include journey orchestration, data health monitoring, and campaign optimization specific to their organization.

The Foundry includes built-in security features, permission controls, auditability, and access management that meet enterprise governance requirements. Organizations can experiment with AI capabilities and deploy agents while maintaining data security, privacy and regulatory compliance. This approach enables customers to build agents that address their specific market dynamics and business processes.

### Practical Applications Driving Results

The specialized agents address several critical marketing use cases through their integration with Amazon Bedrock. Decision support helps marketers evaluate multiple factors simultaneously when determining campaign targeting, messaging, and channel selection. The AI provides recommendations based on comprehensive data analysis rather than intuition alone.

Multiple team members can collaborate with AI agents simultaneously, democratizing access to customer insights across marketing organizations. This capability eliminates bottlenecks caused by limited technical expertise on marketing teams.

The agents continuously learn from customer interactions and campaign performance, enabling organizations to refine their approach and achieve better results through rapid iteration and optimization.
