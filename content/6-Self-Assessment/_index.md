During my internship at AWS First Cloud Journey from 	08/09/2025 to *	28/12/2025, I was able to apply what I had learned in school to real development tasks and gain practical industry experience. I worked on a **meal-planning application**, a system designed to support users who want to cook but lack time to shop for ingredients. Through this project, I expanded my technical abilities in **Spring Framework, PostgreSQL, AWS**, and strengthened my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and software design.

Throughout the internship, I maintained a responsible work attitude, followed company processes, and regularly communicated with teammates to ensure progress and quality.

Below is my self-evaluation based on several key aspects of my internship experience:

### Needs Improvement

Based on my self-assessment, I have identified several areas that I aim to further improve:

- **Technical competence:** Although I have a solid understanding of core concepts, I still need to enhance my proficiency with certain tools and deepen my backend development expertise.
- **Learning adaptability:** While I can learn new technologies, I want to improve my ability to absorb new concepts more quickly and apply them more confidently.
- **Initiative:** I plan to be more proactive in taking ownership of tasks and suggesting improvements during project development.
- **Communication clarity:** I need to work on expressing ideas more clearly, especially when explaining technical issues or reporting progress.
- **Collaboration:** I aim to participate more actively in team discussions and contribute more consistently during group tasks.
- **Analytical and problem-solving skills:** I want to strengthen my ability to identify issues early and propose more effective, well-structured solutions.
- **Overall performance:** Although satisfactory, I see room for growth in consistency, confidence, and technical depth across all assigned responsibilities.

These improvements will help me perform more effectively in future projects and continue developing as a software engineer.
