# Summary Report: “AWS AI/ML Services & Generative AI Workshop”

## Event Objectives
* Provide an overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam.
* Demonstrate end-to-end machine learning workflows using Amazon SageMaker.
* Introduce Generative AI capabilities with Amazon Bedrock (Foundation Models, Agents, Guardrails).
* Share techniques for Prompt Engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Speakers
* **AWS Solutions Architects**
* **AI/ML Specialists**

## Key Highlights

### AWS AI/ML Services Overview (SageMaker)
* **End-to-End Platform:** Covered the full lifecycle from data preparation to deployment.
    * **Data Preparation:** Strategies for labeling and cleaning data.
    * **Training & Tuning:** optimizing models for performance and cost.
    * **Deployment:** Moving models to production endpoints efficiently.
* **Integrated MLOps:** Highlighted capabilities to automate and standardize ML pipelines.
* **SageMaker Studio:** Live demo of the unified interface for building, training, and deploying models.

### Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock
* **Foundation Models (FMs):** Comparison and selection guide for top models:
    * **Claude:** High reasoning capabilities.
    * **Llama:** Open and efficient.
    * **Titan:** Native AWS integration.
* **Prompt Engineering:**
    * **Chain-of-Thought:** Breaking down complex reasoning tasks.
    * **Few-shot learning:** Using examples to improve model output.
* **Advanced Architectures:**
    * **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Integrating Knowledge Bases to ground answers in company data.
    * **Bedrock Agents:** Creating multi-step workflows and integrating with external tools.
    * **Guardrails:** Ensuring safety and content filtering.

## Key Takeaways

### Design Mindset
* **Model Selection:** Choose the right Foundation Model (e.g., Claude vs. Titan) based on the specific use case requirements (speed vs. reasoning).
* **Safety First:** Implementation of **Guardrails** is critical for responsible AI deployment in enterprise settings.

### Technical Architecture
* **RAG over Fine-tuning:** For most internal knowledge use cases, RAG provides a more flexible and cost-effective solution than fine-tuning models.
* **Agentic Workflows:** Moving from passive chatbots to active Agents that can execute tasks is the next frontier of GenAI.

### Modernization Strategy
* **MLOps Adoption:** Moving away from manual model training to automated pipelines (MLOps) is essential for scalability.
* **Local Context:** Understanding the specific AI/ML trends and landscape within Vietnam helps in benchmarking local projects.

## Applying to Work

* **Pilot SageMaker:** Evaluate current ML workflows and identify opportunities to migrate to **Amazon SageMaker** for better lifecycle management.
* **Build a Knowledge Bot:** Create a prototype using **Amazon Bedrock** and **RAG** to query internal documentation or technical manuals.
* **Refine Prompting:** Immediately apply **Chain-of-Thought** and **Few-shot** techniques to improve the accuracy of current AI interactions.
* **Implement Guardrails:** Configure content filters on Bedrock to ensure brand safety for any experimental applications.

## Event Experience

Attending the **“AWS AI/ML Services & Generative AI Workshop”** provided a practical roadmap for adopting intelligent services. Key experiences included:

### Learning from experts
* Gained clarity on the **AI/ML landscape in Vietnam**, understanding local opportunities and challenges.
* Deepened technical knowledge on the differences between major Foundation Models (**Claude, Llama, Titan**).

### Hands-on technical exposure
* The **SageMaker Studio walkthrough** demonstrated how to unify the fragmented ML toolchain into a single pane of glass.
* The **Live Demo of Bedrock** showed the practical implementation of building a Generative AI chatbot, demystifying the complexity of RAG and Agents.

### Networking and discussions
* The **ice-breaker activity** and networking sessions allowed for exchanging ideas with peers about real-world challenges in deploying GenAI.
* Discussions reinforced the importance of **Prompt Engineering** as a critical skill for modern development.

### Lessons learned
* **RAG** is the key to making LLMs useful for business-specific data without the high cost of training.
* **Guardrails** are not optional; they are a fundamental layer of the Generative AI stack.
* Efficiency in ML comes from integrated **MLOps** rather than isolated data science experiments.
